'''
    edit the accented stuff, store it in a big string
    create a HTTP edge case for it
    condense the regex and play around with it
    research chrome extension


    make the feat method much more streamlined DONE
    edit the track name stuff - check for / and take it out if it contains it and test it with different songs (look at
        cameras by drake) DONE
    edit http error stuff - check remove stuff (pseudo)
    edit regex stuff and condense everything (pseudo)
    edit the special characters, keep or take it out (edit - add in case for http section)
    research chrome extension


    1. add in edit for weird punctuation
    2. add in request error link for artists
    3. add in methods to reduce redundancy of code
    4. figure out () - song in parenthesis
        - if info in () is not a lot of words, it is usually included
    5. censored words, maybe have a dictionary it maps to
    6. listing artists again in () after song title



    remastered bonus with ()
    - with featured stuff ab soul
